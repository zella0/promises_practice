  `questions` will be a comma separated list of questions. For example:
  -> 'Will it rain?,Should I bring an umbrella?,Will I find $10 today?'

  You should separate the questions and use the FortuneTeller to
  return a response for each one as an array. For example, the final
  result might be:
  [ 'Yes', 'Outlook good', 'My reply is no' ]

  You do not need to `.catch()` any errors.
